# Stats4EcologistsFiles

Folders (Please do not change anything in these folders!):

- Slides can now be found at [this website](https://statistics4ecologistsslides.netlify.app/)
- FW8051Data includes data for the course
- 2025CodeTemplates contains templates (.R and .Rmd) for completing various exercises
- HandoutsofSlides contains older (pdf version) of the slides but in a handout version (4 slides to a page)

I would encrouage you to create other folders on your local copy (not to be pushed to github):

- MyCode to contain your R code (after modifying the code templates)
- Output to contain reproducible reports created by running your R code
- MyData to contain your own data sets
- MyNotes (or MySlides) if you want to add notes to the slides
